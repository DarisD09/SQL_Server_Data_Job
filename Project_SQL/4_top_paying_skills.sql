Here are three key insights about the top-paying skills:

AI & Automation Dominate – Tools like DataRobot (automated ML) and Couchbase (NoSQL DB for real-time apps) highlight how companies pay a premium for AI-driven and automation-focused expertise.
Programming & Blockchain Skills Pay Big – Solidity (smart contracts) and Golang (high-performance backend) show strong demand in fintech, blockchain, and scalable systems.
Legacy & Specialized Tech Still Valuable – Surprisingly, SVN (older version control) tops the list, showing niche/legacy skills can command high pay when critical to large organizations.

Here’s how the top-paying skills cluster into categories:

Legacy / Specialized Tech – Average ~$400K (e.g., SVN). Rare but critical skills still command the very highest salaries.
Blockchain & Databases – Blockchain (~$179K, Solidity) and Databases (~$160K, Couchbase) are highly valued for driving fintech, Web3, and real-time analytics.
AI / ML & Programming – AI/ML (~$155K, DataRobot) and Programming (~$155K, Golang) reflect the premium on automation and scalable backend development.
